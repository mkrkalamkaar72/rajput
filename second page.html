    <br></br>
    Mihir Sen showed the world that Indians were capable of greatness by becoming the only man to swim across the oceans of five continents in one year.<br></br>
    Born into a family where his mother had to sell chicken eggs and milk to ensure he had a decent education, Sen earned a law degree before going to the United Kingdom for further studies. In the UK, he worked as a night porter at a railway station for some time to support himself.<br></br>
    He wanted to swim the oceans of five continents, starting with crossing the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka in 25 hours and 26 minutes on April 5-6, 1966. Subsequently, he went onto cross the Straits of Gibraltar (Europe to Africa) in a little over 8 hours on 24 August, the Bosphorus in 4 hours, the Dardanelles Straits (Gallipoli, Europe to Sedulbabir, Asia Minor) in nearly 14 hours and the entire length of the Panama Canal in 34 hours and 15 minutes across almost two days—from 29 to 31 October.<br></br>
